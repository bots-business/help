## Blocking Chats  

Each chat entry includes a **Block Button** next to it. Blocking a chat prevents the bot from responding to messages from that specific user or group. This is useful for restricting unwanted interactions or spam.  

### How to Block a Chat  
1. Navigate to the **Chats Section** of a specific bot.  
2. Find the chat you want to block in the list.  
3. Click the **Block Button** next to the chat entry.  

Once blocked, the bot will no longer respond to messages from that chat.

## Unblocking a Chat  

If you want to allow interaction with a previously blocked chat, you can unblock it by clicking the **Unblock Button** next to the chat in the list.
