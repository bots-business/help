## Bot List Overview

When you access the bot management interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all your bots. The bots are listed in a clear, organized manner, allowing you to easily navigate between them. Additionally, each bot has a colour indicator  that informs you about the bot's current state, helping you keep track of which bots are active or need attention.
