## 1. Bot List Overview

When you access the bot management interface, you'll see a comprehensive list of all your bots. The bots are listed in a clear, organized manner, allowing you to easily navigate between them. Additionally, each bot name is accompanied by a **status indicator** that informs you about the bot's current state, helping you keep track of which bots are active or need attention.

- **Bot Name**: Displays the name of each bot. Tap on a bot to access its detailed settings.

## 2. Understanding the Status Indicators

Each bot in your list has a **color-coded status indicator** to show its current state:

- **Green Indicator**: The bot is active and currently running without any issues.
- **Red Indicator**: The bot is inactive or stopped, which may require troubleshooting or configuration adjustments.
- **No Indicator (No Color)**: This indicates the bot hasn't been launched yet or is awaiting further action. Typically, these are bots in development or not yet activated.

These indicators allow you to monitor the health of your bots at a glance, helping you prioritize which bots need immediate attention.

## 3. Actions You Can Take

When you tap on any bot in the list, it will open the **settings page** for that bot. Here, you can perform several actions:

- **Edit the Bot’s Configuration**: Modify the bot's name, commands, and general settings. This allows you to customize the bot's behavior to suit your needs.
- **Manage Bot Commands**: Add, update, or delete commands handled by the bot. You can create new commands that enhance the bot's functionality or tweak existing ones.
- **View Logs**: Access the bot’s activity logs, which are crucial for debugging and monitoring performance. Logs help you identify issues or errors that may affect the bot’s operation.

Each bot’s settings page is designed to give you full control over the bot’s behavior, ensuring you can make necessary changes quickly.

## 4. Bot Status Guide

This guide provides an overview of the different bot statuses and what they mean:

- **Active Bots (Green Indicator)**: These bots are functioning properly. They have been launched and are running without any issues.
- **Stopped Bots (Red Indicator)**: These bots have been stopped or encountered issues that require your attention. They may need to be restarted or reconfigured.
- **Unlaunched Bots (No Indicator)**: These bots have not been activated yet. They may be in development, or you may need to finalize the setup before launching them.

Understanding the statuses will help you maintain your bots’ functionality and ensure that they remain operational.

## 5. What to Do if a Bot is Stopped?

If a bot shows a red indicator, this means the bot has stopped running and requires action. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

1. **Tap on the Bot**: This will open the bot’s settings page, where you can investigate the issue.
2. **Check for Errors in the Logs**: Logs provide detailed insights into the bot’s recent activities and any errors that may have occurred. Look for error messages that point to the cause of the issue.
3. **Verify Bot Settings**: Ensure that the bot’s configuration is correct, including the API token, webhook URLs, and other critical settings.
4. **Restart the Bot**: After making any necessary corrections, restart the bot. This can resolve many common issues, especially if the bot stopped due to a minor error.
