# BB Inspection

BB Team can make "Security and Code Bugs&Style" Inspection for your bot.

This inspection is an indicator of the quality of your bot. After verification, you will receive:

* a quantitative rating of your bot from 0 to 5
* inspection document with descriptions of vulnerabilities, bugs and bad code styling. See [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QCbOTo_c02Gra9zBknFAR5zxtFiKSXmcL5_9iA_RAU/edit#)

{% hint style="success" %}
If you buy a bot from a third-party developer, a good rating is a great reason to buy a bot.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do you have paymernts in your bot? Inspection can help you not to lose money
{% endhint %}
